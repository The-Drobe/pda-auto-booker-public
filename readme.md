# Pda-Auto-Booker
This is an application that I have built to get tests on the [Practical Driving Assessment Bookings Site](https://online.transport.wa.gov.au/pdabooking/manage/?1) for Western Australia. With this you wont need to check back every hour to see if there is a test available

# Install
Head over to the release tab and download the zip. This application only supports windows at the moment. <br>
1. Unzip the file
2. run main.exe
3. Select setup with the number 1 and follow the setup through
4. Run the Bot and wait untill it finds a test with what you specified

# Issues
If any issues apppear report them in the issues tab
